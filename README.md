# Resume

LaTeX template for my personal resume

Based off of [jakegut/resume](https://github.com/jakegut/resume), which was in turn based off of [sb2nov/resume](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume/). I've made some minor formatting (and of course content) modifications.

Use the original on overleaf: [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) (Not updated)
